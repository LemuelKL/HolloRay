- Refering to S.2 in informalAndInternal.txt, how do we distinguish between real and integers when supplying a literal say `4`? 

- How do we do type conversion between real and integer?

- Is it possible to write in ART a function that takes either a real or an integer as an argument? I know that we can always just add another rule, but this doesn't seem to scale well when say we have a function that takes 4 arguments, we have to have 2**4 rules.

- 

- Some naming conventions for writing eSOS rules? E, V, C, _sigP?

- Any difference between _sigP and _sig?

- Anyway to turn down JavaFX's verbosity?
